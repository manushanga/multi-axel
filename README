==================

Compiling
=========

You need Qt development files to build this project having Netbeans is not
essential but it certainly makes building and editing easier, otherwise you can 
just use qmake on the *.pro files in nbproject directory.

install libqt4-dev package

goto the project directory and give these commands

for compiling for 32bit on 64bit host use,
export QMAKESPEC=linux-g++-32
if not just continue with qmake

qmake nbproject/qt-Release.pro
make

./dist will have the binary

Usage
=====

You MUST have axel installed. This program works with Linux kernels only, it 
uses inotify to check for file modification. Any changse to make it cross platform
can be added to fsevent.c

Known Issues
============

Some files end in "Error" state when tried to download after stopping
    This is because axel doesn't make .st files for some downloads specially when
    downloading non-resumable files. You can't resume these files at all, these 
    will have the state "Downloading(not resumable)"

Some files just end in "Error" after sometime
    Some sites ban download accelarators, but they wait until they detect activity
    similar to an accelarator, the only way to fix this is to find another mirror
    or just download with 1 connection
