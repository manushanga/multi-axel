==================

Compiling
=========

You need Qt development files to build this project having Netbeans is not
essential but it certainly makes building and editing easier, otherwise you can 
just use qmake on the *.pro files in nbproject directory.

install libqt4-dev package

goto the project directory and give these commands

qmake nbproject/qt-Release.pro
make

./dist will have the binary

Usage
=====

You MUST have axel installed. This program works with Linux kernels only, it 
uses inotify to check for file modification.
